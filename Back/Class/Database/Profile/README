To create a charge or discharge profile : 

1- Create in the database (The "actions" table) the line with : id, name, brief (that is a brief name for the dataset export),
charge_bool (true = charge profile,false= discharge profile), crate_bool (true if you use crate false if not),
function (the function that will be used to generate the profile),
Note : look into the database to respect the naming convention. (NameFunctionProfile)

2- Create a file in the /Profile folder with the same name as in the database in the function field but without the "Profile".

3- In the file you have to create a class that inherit from the Profile class (don't forget to import the Profile class).
Note : if you use the crate import the ProfileCrate class.


NOTABENE : To inherit properly the profile class you have to implement the following methods :
    __init__(self)
    getAmpl(self)
    getTimeResting(self)
    getTimePulsing(self)

4- Import your new profile in the file "importProfile.py" in the parent folder.
